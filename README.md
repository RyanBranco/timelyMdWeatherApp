# What's the Weather?

A simple weather app the utalizes the OpenWeather API.

Uses the browsers geolocation feature to get the users latitude and longitute to make the first api request. Subsequent requests can be made by typing a city into the search bar.

After the user has searched a city, they have the option to set it as their preferred location. That pins a button at the top that allows them to see the weather for that location at any moment.
